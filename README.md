An approach to data structues such as Linked List, Doubly Linked List and Binary Trees
I do not claim this code to be the only solution or approach, heck it might not even be the best one, but is an attempt to delve into data structures with Java.

I tried to make my methods self-explanatory and tried to write it clean and concise so everyone can follow.
As a note I want to say that I worked with public class attributes instead of encapsulating them with getters and setters which would have been the correct way. I did this to make it more simple, clean and faster.

Linked List and Doubly Linked List:

- In these two data structures I implemented the same approach which was done by selecting a couple of methods from the List interface and implementing them into our new context.

Binary Trees (BST):

- With trees I ended up making a couple of more methods that seemes challenging enough and that would allow me to cement my knowledge.

Hope this helps ...
